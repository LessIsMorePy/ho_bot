How is Python Used?

Python is a general-purpose programming language,
which is another way to say that it can be used for nearly everything.
Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the
written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format
at runtime. Whereas, most programming languages do this conversion
before the program is even run. This type of language is also referred
to as a "scripting language" because it was initially meant to be used
for trivial projects.

The concept of a "scripting language" has changed considerably
since its inception, because Python is now used to write large,
commercial style applications, instead of just banal ones.
This reliance on Python has grown even more so as the internet
gained popularity. A large majority of web applications and
platforms rely on Python, including Google's search engine,
YouTube, and the web-oriented transaction system of the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE). You know the language must be pretty
erious when it's powering a stock exchange system.

In fact, NASA actually uses Python when they are programming t
heir equipment and space machinery. Pretty neat, right?

Python can also be used to process text, display numbers or images,
solve scientific equations, and save data. In short,
it is used behind the scenes to process a lot of elements
 you might need or encounter on your device(s) - mobile included.
